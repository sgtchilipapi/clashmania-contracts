# Random Clash

A trustless Defi Role-Playing-Game on the blockchain.

This project is a complete system of a modern RPG except that it can be deployed on the blockchain for better security and transparency.
It has:

    Character Creation;

    Character Stats;

    Items & Equipment;

    Crafting System;

    Logic-based Battle System; and

    A working in-game economy leveraging secure Defi Practices.

An RPG system of such magnitude running on the blockchain can only be playable or fun if there is a secure way of generating verifiable randomness. One of the most important elements of RPG's or videogames in general are contingencies and random events or outcomes. Without them, everything will be deterministic (most specifically for blockchains) and prone to exploits. Moreover, its not fun.

Thanks to Chainlink Oracle Services for providing us a secure, easy and relatively cost-efficient way of generating randomness. Now games are viable to be played on the blockchain!

Playing Random Clash is free! To start clashing and clanking, you can mint a free NFT character <here>.

# Defi Guide
In-game items are crafting materials (ERC20 tokens) that can be earned either thru battling enemy monsters in dungeons or by way of providing liquidity in the material's token pairs.

The $CLANK! token can only be earned by completing the quest in-game. However, once the token's total supply reaches 200,000, from then on it can only be earned by providing liquidity in the CLANK!-MATIC pair on SushiSwap and staking the LP in our forked MasterChefV2 contract.

Materials such as $BOOM!, $THUMP!, $CLINK! and $SNAP! can only be earned in dungeons when defeating enemy monsters.

Catalysts such as $bSPARK, $wSPARK, $rSPARK, $wSPARK can only be obtained by providing liquidity in the BOOM!-CLANK!, THUMP!-CLANK!, CLINK!-CLANK!, and SNAP!-CLANK! pairs respectively and exchanging the LP tokens with the catalysts in our own custom contract for that.
